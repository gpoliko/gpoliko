### What am I up to? üë®‚Äçüíª
Whether it's code or personal development, I enjoy learning and being curious. Currently I am working as a Test Automation Engineer with Enhance Consulting.

### Let's chat
I enjoy connecting with other people an expanding my network of learning. If you do too, let's meet, have a coffee/beer (non-alcoholic for me)/burger and have a chat!
