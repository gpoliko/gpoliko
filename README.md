## Hi, I'm Giovanni (Gio) Poliko <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px" />

I am a full-stack developer looking to collaborate on initiatives which contribute to social development, especially with under-privileged and minority groups.

Since 2008 I have always had a keen interest on technology, specifically computer science and software development. I appreciate how we can use technology to create solutions to our own problems. As well as helping others leverage technology so they can be empowered to do the same. Recently I, along with 16 other incredible humans, completed an intense and rewarding full stack web development course. A course which not only focused on building technical proficiency, but also the value of working alongside other people.

### What am I up to? üë®‚Äçüíª
Whether it's code or personal development, I enjoy learning and being curious. Currently I am working on personal projects which will consolidate my learning. I am also seeking work opportunities that share my passion for social progress. Being a part of an organisation that encourages growth and values people who build products and services for people is also important to me.

### Let's chat
I enjoy connecting with other people. If you do too, let's meet, have a coffee, beer (non-alcoholic for me), burger and have a chat!
